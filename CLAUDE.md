# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
cargo check          # type-check without linking
cargo build          # debug build
cargo build --release
cargo run            # run the TUI (requires config, see below)
cargo run -- --script run.ncs   # headless: play an action script, no TUI (see Headless)
cargo clippy         # lints
cargo test           # unit tests (app, input, store, client) + TestBackend render tests (ui/tests.rs) + serde fixtures (tests/)
```

## Config

The binary reads `~/.config/neumann-cockpit/config.toml` at startup:

```toml
base_url = "https://neumann-probe.net"
api_key  = "vng_..."
theme    = "mono-green"   # color mode (optional)
hints    = true           # show the contextual hints line (optional)
notifications = true      # desktop notification on long-task completion (optional)
```

- `theme` — cockpit color mode: `mono-green` (default), `mono-amber`, `phosphor-semantic` (green base + green/yellow/red status), or `modern-16` (named ANSI for terminals without truecolor). `F2` cycles it at runtime.
- `hints` — show the contextual hints line at the bottom (`F1` toggles at runtime). Defaults `true`.
- `notifications` — emit a desktop notification (OSC 9 + terminal bell, `src/notify.rs`, issue #203) when a long task finishes: a travel arriving, or a Manny completing a long task (mining, crafting, repair, salvage, upgrade…). Completions are detected in `update_probe` / `update_mannies` (busy→idle diff), staged in `AppState::pending_notifications`, and drained by the event loop. Defaults `true`.

Unknown keys are ignored, so legacy configs (`ui`, `phosphor`, `animations`, `theme = "retro"`) still load.

Copy `config.example.toml` to that path and fill in the API key (generated once via the web UI). **First run needs no manual file**: if the config is missing or has no real key, the boot preflight prompts for an API key and writes `config.toml` for you (see Boot preflight).

Scan history is persisted across runs in a local SQLite database (`cockpit.db`, under the XDG state dir); the legacy `scan_history.json` is migrated into it once, then removed (`src/store.rs`, issue #134).

The same database holds the **ship's log** — an append-only `events` table recording pilot actions (travel, mine, deploy, drop/detach container, storage move…) as narrated captain's-log entries. Actions stage a pre-rendered line into `AppState::pending_journal` (mirroring `pending_fire`), which the event loop drains to persist and prepend to `AppState::journal`. The table is never trimmed (full history kept for long-term stats); only the most recent `store::JOURNAL_WINDOW` are loaded into memory at boot. The Missions-pane view (`AppState::ship_log_entries`) merges these captured actions with reconstructed server events (alerts + damage warnings, projected fresh from memory rather than persisted, since the server keeps them), newest first.

The database also holds a **telemetry** time series (`telemetry` table, issue #201) — periodic samples of the piloted probe's vital ratios (fuel / integrity / cargo, each `0..1`), tagged by active probe id. `AppState::update_probe` samples on each sync, deduped against the last sample for that probe (idle probes don't flood the series); kept samples stage into `AppState::pending_telemetry` (mirroring `pending_journal`) and the event loop drains them to persist. Append-only, never trimmed; the recent `store::TELEMETRY_WINDOW` load into `AppState::telemetry` at boot. The zoomed Probe pane draws a Unicode sparkline (`theme::text_sparkline`) under each vital gauge from the active probe's tail.

**Naming ceremony**: the rename wizards (probe / Manny / storage container) open pre-filled with a Culture-style name suggestion from `src/app/lexicon.rs` (`AppState::next_name_suggestion` cycles the bank); `Tab` regenerates a suggestion, `Enter` applies, editing is free-form, and `Esc` keeps the current name. The API has no name-at-creation (and an assembled drone only appears ~3 h later), so naming is always a post-hoc rename.

## Architecture

### Boot preflight (`src/preflight.rs` + `src/ui/preflight.rs`)

`main()` enters the alternate screen **before** any fallible startup, then runs `preflight::run()`, which draws the boot grid with the real check-list **inside the centre Probe pane** (the eight surrounding subsystems stay dark until the link comes up) and returns a `preflight::Ready` (config, `ApiClient`, DB connection, scan history, api_version, link_ok) or `Outcome::Quit`. This is the Windows first-run fix: `Config::load()` used to error out before the terminal existed, so a double-clicked binary flashed a console and vanished — now every failure has an in-TUI outcome. Steps:

- **CONFIG** — `Config::load_status()` returns `Ready` / `NeedsKey` / `Invalid` (a lenient parse so a keyless file doesn't error). On `NeedsKey`/`Invalid`, an onboarding prompt in the Probe pane collects an API key and `config::write_config()` writes `config.toml` (base URL defaulted to `DEFAULT_BASE_URL`); Esc/Ctrl-C quits cleanly.
- **ARCHIVE** — `store::open` + `migrate_legacy_json` (reports `MigrationOutcome`: imported N / already migrated / none) + `load_observations`.
- **REMOTE LINK** — `get_api_version()` under an 8 s timeout, retried interactively: a bad key or outage shows in the Probe pane with actions — `[R]` retry · `[K]` re-enter key (re-runs onboarding) · `[Enter]` continue offline. Continuing enters **degraded mode** (an error toast; `F5` retries), per the API-KO decision.

Once the link is up (or the pilot continues offline), it hands off to `run()`, which builds `AppState`, spawns the persistence writer from the preflight's connection, and plays the cosmetic boot animation that lights the eight subsystems centre-out (see UI › Boot). The writer returns a shared `degraded` flag it raises if any write fails (disk full, corruption); it never crashes the thread (keeps draining), and the event loop mirrors the flag into `AppState::persistence_degraded`, surfaced as a `⚠ save failing` status-bar chip (issue #216).

### Headless script runner (`src/headless.rs`, #198 extension)

`main()` checks `headless::script_arg(argv)` **before** touching the terminal: `--script <file>` / `-s <file>` / `--script=<file>` runs `headless::run()` and `process::exit`s with its code; a bare launch is the interactive cockpit, unchanged. The runner plays an action script from a file with **no TUI**: it loads the config non-interactively (no key onboarding — errors to stderr), opens the same SQLite DB, `fetch_all`s and waits until the probe + mannies rosters are primed, then parses the file (one command per line; blank lines and `#` comments skipped) via `parse_script_line` and runs it through the **same** `advance_script` executor (sequential, fork/join, late binding). It reuses the cockpit's `fetch_*` spawners and a minimal `ApiMessage` dispatch (refresh `probe`/`mannies`/`sector`; route the six MVP verb errors to `script_note_error`). Ship's-log entries are streamed to stdout (`HH:MM:SS » narrated summary`, plus `✓`/`✗` per step and a final status line) **and** persisted to the `events` table, so a headless run appears in the next TUI session's ship's log. Exit code: `0` on completion, `1` if the script halted on an error. This is the first non-TUI surface; #229 tracks a headless **status** mode sharing the same seams.

### Event loop (`src/main.rs`)

Single `tokio::select!` loop over three sources:

- **crossterm `EventStream`** — keyboard / mouse / resize events
- **`mpsc::Receiver<ApiMessage>`** — results from spawned API tasks
- **`tokio::time::sleep_until(deadline)`** — auto-refresh timer

The timer deadline is set to `movement.arrival_at` (ISO 8601) converted to a `tokio::time::Instant`. When no movement is in progress the deadline is 24 h away — no polling.

Two more `select!` branches are timers: a **short-lived ~90 ms boot tick** (guarded by `state.booting`, runs only during the startup boot sequence — see UI › Boot — then stops) and a **steady-state 1 s `ui_tick`** that redraws so time-derived values (progress bars, ETAs, sync age) advance and fires the periodic auto-refresh when one is due.

`fetch_all()` spawns **seven** independent `tokio::spawn` tasks: probe, mannies, sector, visited sectors, alerts, damage warnings, and missions. All but probe are non-fatal.

All other API calls (move, repair, mine, craft, storage container CRUD, storage moves, etc.) are also spawned tasks that send results back via the `mpsc::Sender<ApiMessage>`. Keyboard handlers live in `src/input/` (`mod.rs` holds `handle_event`, which runs the shared wizard/overlay handlers then dispatches navigation to `cockpit.rs`; one module per wizard handler — `pickers.rs` groups the manny pick-list/confirm ones, `containers.rs` the storage-container ones, `storage_move.rs`, `alerts.rs`, `geometry.rs` for the scan offset helpers); fetch spawners live in `src/api/tasks.rs`. `main.rs` only contains the select loop and the `ApiMessage` dispatch (which also sets the success toasts).

### State (`src/app/`)

`AppState` is the single source of truth passed to the renderer. Split by domain: `mod.rs` (struct `AppState`, core impl — updates, toasts, refresh deadline — and `pub use` re-exports keeping `crate::app::*` paths stable), `grid.rs` (`Pane` — the 9 cockpit panes — + `PaneNav` per-pane cursor/drill state + grid navigation helpers), `mode.rs` (`InputMode`, `ContextMenu`, `MenuAction`, `MenuItem`), `boot.rs` (startup self-check schedule), `color.rs` (`ColorMode`), `inputs.rs` (all wizard input enums + constants), `scan.rs`, `travel.rs`, `inventory.rs`, `mannies.rs`, `containers.rs` (storage-container/move helpers), `map.rs`, `waypoints.rs`, `message.rs` (`ApiMessage`), `journal.rs` (`LogEvent` — the ship's-log entry type + narrative constructors), `lexicon.rs` (naming-ceremony name bank), `tests.rs` (unit tests). Key design choices:

- **Cockpit v2 state**: `active_pane: Pane`, `zoomed: bool`, `mode: InputMode` (`Normal` / `Menu` / `Command`), `pane_nav: [PaneNav; 9]` (cursor + drill-in stack per pane), `hints_visible`, `color_mode`, and `booting` / `boot_frame` for the startup sequence. `build_context_menu()` produces the `Enter` menu for the active pane; menu items map to `MenuAction`s that launch the existing wizards.
- The four reused panel renderers (Probe/Inventory/Scanner/Mannies) take an `active: bool` to mark the active pane; the old `Panel` enum + `focused` state and the classic single-key action handlers are gone.

- Each interactive action (travel, repair, mine, fabricate, jettison, salvage, recall, rename, deploy, inspect, recover, detach, object actions, waypoints, alerts, storage containers + rename + routing rules, storage moves, drop cargo) has its own input state enum (`TravelInput`, `RepairInput`, `ObjectActionInput`, `AlertsInput`, `ContainersInput`, `ContainerRulesInput`, `StorageMoveInput`, etc.) with variants for each wizard step. All start as `Inactive`.
- **Fabrication is the production console** (`FabricationInput` + the queue in `app/queue.rs`, #197): one item-first catalog spanning both fabricators — `fabrication_recipes()` pairs every recipe with its `Fabricator` (atomic printer first, then Manny), sectioned in the catalog. Opening it (`:craft`, `:queue`, or the Mannies/Inventory pane menus) shows three panels: recipe catalog · selected-recipe detail · the live **production queue**. On the catalog, `+`/`-` (or `h`/`l`) set a quantity and `Enter` adds the recipe ×qty to the queue (identical trailing steps coalesce into one `×N`); a Manny recipe resolves its builder like an immediate craft (pre-chosen from the Mannies pane, sole idle onboard Manny, else `PickBuilder`). `Tab` focuses the queue panel to manage it (`+`/`-` a step's repeat, `x` remove, `c` clear). The queue **auto-runs** and is organised into **lanes** — one per builder Manny plus one for the atomic printer — running one craft per lane but lanes in **parallel**; completion is polled (the builder idle again, or no Manny still assisting the printer). It **pauses** (`p`, or on a craft failure — `fail_queue`), is capped at `QUEUE_MAX` (32), and is session-only. The executor (`advance_queue`) stages `CraftFire`s in `queue_fire` that the event loop drains (`fetch_craft` / `atomic-printer/craft`); a status-bar chip `⛭ done/total` shows progress with the console closed.
- **Action scripting is the second sequencer** (`app/script.rs`, #198): compose a **linear sequence** of heterogeneous pilot actions ("detach a container → travel → mine → recover it") that runs **strictly one step at a time** — step N fires only once N-1 completes. It reuses the queue's primitives (`StepState`, the `pending_fire`/drain firing pattern) but with the opposite execution model: one sequential lane vs. the queue's parallel per-builder lanes. Verbs: `travel`, `mine`, `repair`, `salvage`, `detach`, `recover`, `craft` (extensible verb by verb via `ScriptVerb`/`resolve`). `craft <recipe[,recipe…]> [by <manny|all|A,B>]` (#258) fabricates one recipe per step, or **fans out a recipe list one-per-builder** (parallel, join — like `mine by all`) so parts are made concurrently then assembled by the next line; resolved against `fabrication_recipes`; a Manny recipe completes on its builder busy→idle, an atomic-printer recipe when no Manny is assisting the printer (`action_in_progress` special-cases it). Opened with `:script` (`ActiveWizard::Script(ScriptInput)`), a **vim-style modal editor**: `Insert` types a `:`-style command line (`Enter` validates it via `parse_script_line` and appends a `ScriptStep`), `Normal` navigates/manages (`j`/`k`, `x` remove, `c` clear, `R` run, `p` pause). Unlike the auto-running queue, a script is composed then explicitly **run** (`script_running`, default off). Two design points: (1) **late binding** — a line is validated *syntactically* on add, but its targets (builder Manny, asteroid, container) resolve against **live** state only when the step fires, so a `mine` binds to the sector the probe *arrives* in after a preceding `travel`; the shared `resolve_mine_target` / `mine_buckets` (in `command.rs`) back both `:mine` and the scripted mine. `at <…>` and `pick_one` match an **exact object id** first, then a name substring — so an unnamed nested asteroid is addressable by the `id` the zoomed Sector view prints under each body (`solar_system_zoom_lines` / `sector_object_lines`). Both `parse_script_line` and `run_command` tokenize via `command::tokenize` (**quote-aware**: a `"…"` span is one atomic token keeping its quotes so keyword-matching in `split_kw`/`mine_buckets` skips it, `command::dequote` strips them at use) — so a target name may contain spaces *or* a keyword (`to "Ready to Go"`). (2) **fork/join** — a step is a **group** of actions: most resolve to one, but a fan-out `mine … by all|A,B` resolves to one action per builder, all fired together, and the step acts as a **barrier** (done only once every builder is idle again). Completion mirrors the queue (Manny busy→idle via `can_receive_orders`; travel via `movement_arrival`), the `observed_busy` guard covering the fire→busy lag. The executor (`advance_script`) stages resolved `ScriptAction`s in `script_fire` that the event loop drains (mapping each variant to its `fetch_*`); on each step firing it logs a **narrated** captain's-log entry (`script_log_event`, kind + `«…»` summary; a fan-out mine reports the builder count) into `pending_journal`, exactly like the interactive actions. It **halts** on a resolve failure or an action error while a step is in flight (`fail_script` / `script_note_error`, called from the six MVP error arms), is capped at `SCRIPT_MAX` (32), and is session-only. A status-bar chip `≡ done/total` shows progress with the console closed.
- `update_probe()` extracts `movement_arrival` from the response and stores it separately so the event loop can compute the next deadline without re-reading the full probe struct.
- Scan history is cached in `AppState::scan_history` (a `Vec<SectorObservation>`) and persisted to disk asynchronously after each sector fetch. Each observation is stamped on receipt with a local `scanned_at` and an `observed_by` probe id (both serde-defaulted, so old history files load). The history is a **unified fleet-wide store** — SCUT shares sector knowledge across probes, so switching the active probe never partitions or clears it; `observed_by` is provenance only. The SQLite `observed_by` column is back-filled on existing DBs via `store::ensure_columns` (`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`).
- Panel cursors: `mannies_selection`, `inventory_selection` (rows built by `inventory_rows()` — stocks, active items, passive groups), `scan_history_idx` (moves within `filtered_history_indices()` when a `ScanFilter` is active), `scanner_obj_selection` (object-browsing mode, entries from `scanner_objects()`).
- `jettison_for_selected()` builds the jettison wizard from the selected inventory row; `actions_for_object()` maps a `ScannerObjectEntry` to its available `ObjectAction`s, mirroring the manny-first candidate sets (`collect_*_candidates`).
- Transient success toasts: `set_toast()` / `active_toast()` (5 s expiry, dismissed by any keypress).
- `RESOURCE_TYPES`, `MOVE_RESOURCE_TYPES`, and `DETACH_MODES` constants live here (not in `main.rs` or the UI).

### API layer (`src/api/`)

- `types.rs` — all OpenAPI types. Structs use `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]`; enums use `#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]` with `#[serde(other)] Unknown` fallbacks. `#![allow(dead_code)]` suppresses warnings on fields not yet consumed by the UI.
- `client.rs` — `ApiClient` (cloneable, wraps `reqwest::Client`). Each endpoint has a typed wrapper with an inline `struct Resp` that deserializes the envelope and returns the inner value. HTTP errors extract `error.message` from the JSON body; 401 produces a specific "check your api_key" message.
  - **Multi-probe seam (API v81)**: `ApiClient` carries an `active_probe_id: Option<u64>`; per-probe wrappers build their path via `probe_path(suffix)` — `None` → `/api/probe{suffix}` (default probe, pre-v81 behaviour), `Some(id)` → `/api/probe/{id}{suffix}` (the `{probeId}` mirrors). `with_active_probe(id)` returns a retargeted clone (used by the cockpit to switch probes without touching the server default). Player-level endpoints (`/api/version`, `/api/sector`, `/api/crafting-recipes`, `/api/probes`, `/api/probe/missions*`, `/api/probe/messages/sent`, `/api/probe/mind-snapshot/reassign`) have **no** `{probeId}` mirror and stay literal.

### Theme & colours (`src/ui/theme.rs`)

One unified phosphor theme (there is no classic/retro split any more). `theme.rs` holds the shared helpers: `Palette` + `palette(ColorMode)` (accent / dim / text / good / warn / crit per color mode), `pane_block(title, active, palette)` — the double-line (`BorderType::Double`) pane frame used by every pane, coloured accent when active and dim-accent otherwise — plus icons, labels, gauges (`make_line_gauge`, `gauge_color`), `text_sparkline` (Unicode `▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█` trend line, used by the zoomed Probe telemetry), and `format_duration` / `format_age`. Color modes: `mono-green` (default), `mono-amber`, `phosphor-semantic`, `modern-16`; `F2` cycles them.

### UI (`src/ui/`)

`ui::render` → `cockpit_v2::render(frame, state)` is the single render entry point. Module layout: `cockpit_v2/` (`mod.rs` entry point — grid layout, status bar, boot screen; `grid.rs` responsive window; `panes.rs` compact renderers for the five promoted panes; `menu.rs` contextual-menu popup), `panels/` (the four original panel renderers, reused by the grid: `probe`, `inventory`, `scanner`, `mannies`), `overlays/` (one file per wizard overlay; `pickers.rs` groups the manny pick-list/confirm ones, `containers.rs` the storage-container ones, plus `alerts.rs` / `storage_move.rs`; `mod.rs` hosts `centered_rect` + `render_pick_list`), `theme.rs`, `sigil.rs`.

**Probe sigil** (`src/ui/sigil.rs`, API v81) — `probe_sigil(id)` builds a deterministic 7×7 mirror-symmetric identicon (FNV-1a over the id, stable across runs — **not** the randomized default hasher; 7×4 = 28 free bits ≈ 268M patterns). `sigil_lines(id, palette, indent)` renders it as 4 half-block (`▀▄█`) lines in the accent colour. The Probe pane pins the **active probe's** sigil to its top-right corner, always visible in every mode/theme, so probes/drones are told apart at a glance (`panels/probe.rs`).

**The grid** — a 3×3 tiling dashboard of nine panes, each addressable by a key in the `e r t / d f g / c v b` square (identical on AZERTY and QWERTY; centre `f` = Probe). Model: *navigate then act*.

```

**Keys** — `e r t d f g c v b` activate a pane · `j`/`k` (`↑`/`↓`) move the cursor · `l`/`→` drill in, `h`/`←` drill out (Missions → steps, Comms → message) · `Enter` opens the contextual action menu · `z` zooms the active pane full-screen · `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` cycle panes · `:` command mode · `i` jump to the next idle Manny (focuses the Mannies pane) · `F1` toggle hints · `F2` cycle color mode · `F5` refresh · `?` help · `q` quit · `Esc` closes menu / leaves zoom / drills up.

**Contextual menu** (`Enter`) — built per active pane + selection (`build_context_menu` → `Vec<MenuItem>`, disabled items shown with a reason). Firing an item launches the existing wizard (`MenuAction` → the matching `*Input`). Panes with rich wizards (Missions, Comms, Storage, Sector objects) reuse their legacy overlays instead of the popup.

**Responsive** — `grid::visible_panes` fits `rows × cols` whole panes (each 1..=3 from a minimum cell size) and slides the window to keep the active pane visible: 3×3 on a large terminal, 2×2 on a half-screen, a single row on a short wide split, one pane when tiny. A position mini-map in the status bar (the nine keys in three groups) shows where the active pane sits whenever the grid is reduced.

**Status bar** — `[MODE]` tag (NAV / MENU / CMD, or ZOOM) · breadcrumb (`COCKPIT › PANE › …`) · transient error (crit) or success toast · right-aligned meta (`⟳` while loading, active probe `⏻ name` when the fleet has >1 probe or the pilot is off the default — accented when non-default, `⚠` when unreachable, `≣ SCUT`, `⚙ N idle` (idle Mannies, bold warn — `i` cycles to the next), unread `! n`, `API vN`, clock). A second **hints line** (toggle `F1`) shows the keys valid for the active pane.

**Boot** (`src/app/boot.rs` + `cockpit_v2::render_boot`) — on startup the probe core boots first (centre pane self-check), then the eight subsystems come online centre-out, each typing a themed teletype self-check (SUDDAR array, SCUT link, autofactory, manny bay…). Once done it holds on `ANY KEY TO CONTINUE` in the centre pane; any key drops into the live cockpit (or skips the animation). Driven by the bounded boot tick.

The four reused panels (Probe / Inventory / Scanner / Mannies) keep their internal content colours; gauge colors: green > 50 %, yellow 25–50 %, red < 25 %. Movement progress is derived from `started_at` / `arrival_at` client-side. Scanner history shows symbol + coords + distance and scrolls with the selection.

**Overlays** (wizards, rendered on top of the grid; launched from the contextual menu or the reused panels):
- **Mannies pane menu** (`Enter`) — Fabricate, Mine, Repair, Salvage, Inspect, Recover/Detach container, Refill deuterium, **Transfer deuterium…**, **Transfer Manny…**, Drop cargo, **Assemble probe…**, Recall/Abandon, Rename. **Transfer Manny…** (API v93; enabled on an orderable Manny when the fleet holds another probe) opens a single-step picker (`TransferProbeInput`) — choose the destination probe (the piloted source excluded), `Enter` fires the `transfer-to-probe` task (`fetch_transfer_manny`, duration = a container detach). The same-sector-or-SCUT requirement is server-validated, so a wrong target surfaces as a 422 in the picker; `other_fleet_probes` supplies the candidates (shared with Transfer deuterium). **Transfer deuterium…** (API v86; enabled on an orderable Manny when the fleet holds another probe) opens a two-step wizard (`TransferDeuteriumInput`): pick a destination probe from the roster (the piloted source is excluded), then enter the deuterium percentage to ferry; `Enter` fires the five-minute `transfer-deuterium-to-probe` task (`fetch_transfer_deuterium`). The same-sector requirement is server-validated — the roster carries no coordinates, so a wrong target surfaces as a 422 error in the amount step; the target is topped up to its capacity and any surplus returns to the source. **Assemble probe…** (API v81; enabled on an orderable Manny with ≥2 empty additional containers) opens the assembly wizard (`AssembleProbeInput`): a single multi-select of exactly two empty containers with the fixed component bill shown; `Space` toggles, `Enter` fires the ~3h `assemble-probe` task that spawns a new drone in the sector (`fetch_assemble_probe`). Each launches its wizard (`*Input`). Fabricate opens the production console with the selected Manny pre-chosen as builder. Inspect (`inspect-sector-object`, API v65) targets any inspectable object — asteroid, dormant construct, or detached container (`collect_inspectable_candidates`). Remote mine (SCUT-reachable manny) fetches the manny's sector first, then picks asteroid → resources/amount → mandatory detached container. Recall on a SCUT-remote manny is labelled **abandon**. A mining Manny that turns up a hidden container flags **⚠ hidden container found** in its detail (`manny_artificial_detection` reads `artificialObjectDetected` from the task payload).
- **Inventory pane menu** (`Enter`) — Fabricate, Move stock, Jettison, and **Deploy waypoint…** (only when a `waypoint_bookmark` is held; picks the installing Manny → sector target → name, firing `install-bookmark`). Fabricate opens the production console with no builder pre-chosen.
- **Missions pane** — a root with two categories (`DrillLevel::MissionsCat`, drilled like Comms): **Missions** (active-mission list with steps/status; `Enter` → abandon confirmation) and **Ship's log** (the captain's-log flow — newest-first narrated entries, dimmed timestamp, entities in accent, server events in warn; lines truncate to the pane width when compact and read out in full when zoomed). `l`/`Enter` at the root enters a category, `h`/`Esc` backs out. Parked in the Missions pane for now — modular so it can graduate to its own pane later.
- **Comms pane** — a category root (`DrillLevel::CommsCat`): **Messages**, **Alerts**, **Warnings**, each with its unread count and a one-line preview of its most recent entry. `l`/`Enter` on a category: **Messages** opens the messaging overlay (inbox/sent tabs, `Enter` reads a message full-screen — body + emission sector `ProbeMessage.sector`, API v71 —, `c` composes to a probe/planet recipient); **Alerts** / **Warnings** drill into an in-pane list rendered right in the pane, where `Enter` acknowledges the selected entry. `h`/`Esc` backs out to the root.
- **Storage pane** (`Enter`) — container browser with capacity bars; content view, rename, routing-rules editor (none → priority → exclusion → strict).
- **Sector pane** (`Enter` on an object) — object-action picker (mine / inspect / salvage / recover / deploy waypoint); inspect is offered on asteroids, **dormant constructs**, and detached containers; an inactive `scut_relay` offers **turn on relay** (needs a star + integrated_circuit) and salvage; an **active** relay without a beacon offers **install transit beacon** (API v96; consumes a `scut_transit_beacon`, fires `install-scut-transit-beacon`). A relay already carrying a beacon shows a `⚡ transit beacon` marker in its object line.
- **Map pane** — compact summary; `z` opens the full isometric map (pan `hjkl`, `g` travel to the centred sector, `c` coordinate center). `Enter` menu: open map, **Travel to coordinates…**, **Jump to visited sector…** (picker over `visited_sectors`), **Waypoints…** (picker over bookmarks/stars/mineable targets). Scanner `Enter` also offers **Travel here** to the selected observation.
- **Travel** wizard — coordinate input (absolute, or relative with a leading `+`), live parity check, fuel/ETA preview + confirmation. Launched from Map/Scanner or `:travel`.
- **Probe pane menu** (`Enter`) — **Switch probe…** (multi-probe, API v81; enabled with >1 probe, opens the fleet picker), **Set as default probe** (`PATCH /api/probe/{id}` `isDefault`; shown when the active probe isn't default, disabled + reasoned when it's out of SCUT range), **Rename probe…** (`PATCH /api/probe/{id}` `name`, text-entry wizard `RenameProbeInput`; renames the piloted probe, available even with a single probe), **Inspect SCUT network…** (enabled when a SCUT relay covers the current sector; auto-views the sole network or picks among several via `scut-network/{id}`), **Improve probe…** (enabled when an unlocked, not-yet-done improvement exists; two-panel catalog → resolve the installing Manny → `improve-probe`), plus **Reassign mind snapshot** only when the probe is dead or trapped by a black hole (`probe.alert`); reassigns the snapshot to a fresh probe. Improvements are fetched in `fetch_all` (`ProbeImprovement`).
  - **Fleet switching (API v81)**: the active probe is client-side (`AppState::active_probe_id`, `None` = default). The picker (`ProbeSwitchInput`, `render_probe_switch_overlay`) lists the roster with default (★) / active (▸) markers, status, and SCUT reachability; `Enter` pilots a reachable probe (refuses an unreachable one with a toast). Switching only sets `active_probe_id`; the event loop in `main.rs` reconciles the `ApiClient` (`with_active_probe`) and refetches. Also reachable via `:probe <id|name>`. The Probe panel (`panels/probe.rs`) flags a piloted non-default drone (▸ accented name), shows a compact `fleet N probes` line, and unfolds the full roster (default ★ / active ▸ / SCUT reach) when zoomed (`z`) — a fleet cockpit. All fleet UI is gated on `fleet.len() > 1`, so single-probe play is unchanged.
- **Command mode** (`:`) — `focus <pane>` · `travel <x y z|+dx dy dz>` · `goto <x y z>` · `filter <all|objects|minable|danger>` · `craft [recipe]` · `queue` · `script` · `mine [res[,res]] [amount] [by <manny>] [at <asteroid>] [to <container>]` · `probe <id|name>` · `refresh` · `theme <mode>` · `zoom` · `help` · `q`. `Tab` completes and cycles both the verb and enumerable arguments (`AppState::command_completions`; candidate list / usage ghost-text shown on the command line), `↑`/`↓` browse history (`AppState::command_history`), the recognised verb's argument usage comes from `command_usage`; verbs live in `AppState::run_command` (`app/command.rs`). `craft`/`queue` both open the **production console** (bare); `craft <recipe>` enqueues that recipe (all crafting flows through the queue now — there is no immediate one-off craft). `mine` stays **hybrid**: bare opens the wizard, a full line fires directly — since `run_command` owns no `ApiClient`/sender, a one-shot `:mine` stages a `CommandFire` in `AppState::pending_fire` that the input layer (`input/command.rs`) drains and spawns (`fetch_mine`). `:mine` resolves the builder/asteroid from context (sole idle onboard Manny, sole mineable object), overridable via `by`/`at`, destination defaulting to the probe (`to <container>` to redirect); local mining only. `script` opens the action-scripting console (see the script engine above).
- Shared bits: `EndpointId` is an untagged int|string (probe id | planet object id). `Manny.taskVisibility` (`local` / `scut_network` / `too_far`) drives remote display (`≣ via SCUT` / `too far`).

**All wizards are now wired to a cockpit launcher** — Travel, the full isometric Map (`z` on the Map pane), Waypoints, mind-snapshot reassign, drop-storage-container, SCUT-network inspect (Probe pane), deploy-waypoint (Inventory pane), and command mode (`:`).

## Implemented API endpoints

<!-- The live server version shows as "API vN" in the status bar; the versioned
     contract lives in api-specs/. Keep this table, but not a hardcoded version. -->

**API tracking (issue #238, live v96).** Latest spec `api-specs/v96.yaml`. Catch-up v86→v96 is **phased**: Phase 1 (done) is additive field tracking + audits — `sector.distances` (v89, per-probe; the Scanner/Map show the **active** probe's distance via `SectorObservation::active_distance`), `ScutRelay.is_transit_beacon` / `SectorObject.is_transit_beacon` (v96), and confirmation that v87 (canonical item names — no client translation), v88 (salvageable tightening — we never surfaced drifting-item salvage), v92 (recall releases components server-side), v95 (new recipe is data-driven) need no code change. Phase 2 (interactive endpoints) is done except the logbook: `transfer-to-probe` (v93), `detach-storage-container` `attach_to_probe` mode (v91), `install-scut-transit-beacon` + `isTransitBeacon` display (v96), and fleet reconciliation when the **active** probe is destroyed (v94 — `update_fleet` reverts `active_probe_id` to the default when the piloted probe drops off the roster). **Deferred**: the v90 server logbook CRUD (kept **separate** from the local ship's log — tracked in its own issue #254) and the v96 safe-corridor *travel* awareness.
